            <h2>What is Glaucoma?</h2>
            <p>Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions leading to optic nerve damage, often associated with elevated intraocular pressure. It's one of the leading causes of blindness for people over 60 years old. However, blindness from glaucoma can often be prevented with early treatment.</p>

            <h2>Types of Glaucoma</h2>
            <p>There are several types of glaucoma, with the two main categories being open-angle glaucoma, which is slow to progress, and angle-closure glaucoma, which can present suddenly and is a medical emergency.</p>

            <h2>Recognizing Glaucoma</h2>
            <p>Symptoms vary depending on the type and stage of glaucoma, from no initial symptoms in open-angle glaucoma to severe eye pain, nausea, red eyes, and blurred vision in angle-closure glaucoma. Regular eye exams are crucial for early detection.</p>

            <h2>Care for Glaucoma</h2>
            <p>Treatment can't reverse any damage to the eyes. However, treatment and regular check-ups can help slow or prevent vision loss, especially if you catch the disease in its early stages. Glaucoma is usually controlled with eyedrop medication. Laser treatments and surgeries are also options to reduce pressure in the eye.</p>
